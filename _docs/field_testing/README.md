# Field Testing

This is a technical guide for installing and troubleshooting for field testing.

## Before you leave

* Create a Webmaker account (on an android device, or go to https://webmaker-app.mofostaging.net/sign-in) to use for testing with users that don't have emails
* Note that an email is still required for users to sign up for accounts

## When you arrive

### Preparing a device for testing (Android)

* Visit [http://mzl.la/android](http://mzl.la/android) on the device. Download and install application.
* Quickly run through a few actions to make sure things are working as expected (list of actions =>todo)

## Flight rules (Android)

#### I can't load the install URL/the URL seems to be down.

* Try downloading directly from https://webmaker-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/android/Webmaker-debug.apk
* As a second resort, load the web app in Chrome/Android browser: https://webmaker-app.mofostaging.net/sign-in
* As a last resort, load the web app nightly build (unstable): http://webmaker-app.mofodev.net

#### I get an error while logging in

* Try a different email
* As a last resort, use guest mode.

#### I can't publish/I get an error while publishing

* Check if your network connection is very slow or if you are offline. If this is the case, you will *not* be able to publish
